/**
 * Block rendering dispatcher.
 *
 * Handles the `Block.<handler>.display` event.
 *
 * Each block has a `handler` property which identifies the plugin that created
 * that Block, by default all blocks created using backend's administration page
 * defines `Block` has their handler.
 *
 * An external plugin may register a custom block by inserting its information
 * directly in the "blocks" table and setting an appropriate `handler` name.
 *
 * For example, `Taxonomy` plugin may create a new `Categories` block by inserting
 * its information in the "blocks" table, this new block may have `Taxonomy` as
 * handler name.
 *
 * Block's handler property is used to compose event's name that is triggered
 * when block is being rendered (or edited). Event's name follows the pattern
 * described below:
 *
 *     Block.<handler>.<display|settings>
 *
 * So all blocks with `Block` as handler will trigger the event below when
 * being rendered:
 *
 *     Block.Block.display
 *
 * The event described above is handled by this class. In the other hand, for
 * the taxonomy example described above the following event will be triggered
 * when rendering the `Categories` block:
 *
 *     Block.Taxonomy.display
 *
 * Taxonomy plugin should catch this event and return a STRING.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **NOTES:**
 *
 * - Event's subject is always the View instance being used.
 * - Plugins are allowed to define any `handler` name when registering blocks in
 *   the "blocks" table, the only constraint is that it must be unique in the
 *   entire "blocks" table. Use plugin's name itself is always a good practice
 *   as it's already unique in the whole system. Anyway, handler names such as
 *   `random-letters`, or `i-like-trains` are valid as well.

     * - `render_block_footer_search-result.ctp`: Render for blocks in `footer`

     * ### Render block based on theme's region
     *
     *     render_block_[region-name]
     *
     * Similar as before, but based on theme's `region` (and any view-mode), for
     * example:
     *
     * - `render_block_right-sidebar.ctp`: Render for blocks in `right-sidebar` region.
     *
     * - `render_block_left-sidebar.ctp` Render for blocks in `left-sidebar` region.

     * ### Default
     *
     *     render_block.ctp
     *
     * This is the global render, if none of the above is found we try to use this last.
